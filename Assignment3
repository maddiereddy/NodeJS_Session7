Why to use NodeJS:

1. Highly constructive connection management
2. Supports web projects of exceptionally high load with swift response
3. Excellent coupling between client and server
4. Cloud scalability
5. Compatibility
6. Built almost twice as fast with fewer people.
7. Written in 33% fewer lines of code
8. Constructed with 40% fewer files
9. Handles asynchronous I/O requests with a non-blocking, single-threaded event loop. It is particularly well-suited to distributed systems that make a lot of network requests.
10. Is excellent for quick iteration; programs can be inspected and errors can be addressed on the fly without requiring a restart, so developers can publish and deploy new code constantly.
11. The active open source community continuously optimizes the technology; it gets better, all the time, practically on its own.
